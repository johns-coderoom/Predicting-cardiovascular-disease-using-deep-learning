# Predicting-cardiovascular-disease-using-deep-learning
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) by utilizing artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze both structured and unstructured CVD-related data.

1. Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Project Interface
This interface demonstrates how users interact with the system. Key features include:

  *  (i) Intuitive data input fields for user convenience.
  *  (ii)  An output section displaying risk predictions clearly.
  *  (iii) Back-end integration of machine learning algorithms for prediction analysis.
